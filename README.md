## Face recognition

[InsightFace/ArcFace](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface) recognition model is used to preform face recognition. Faces are saved in a list of recognized faces once they are recognized as a new face. A face is recognized as a new face if none of the other recognized faces doesn't achieve higher similarity than `FACE_CONF_THRESHOLD`. Face recognition can be easily switched on by using `retina_face` detector and setting `retina_face.Recognition = True`.
